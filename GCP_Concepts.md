# What is cloud computing
Cloud computing is a way of using information technology (IT) that has these five equally important traits

- 1. Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service
- 2. Customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere
- 3. The provider of those resources allocates them to users out of that pool
- 4. Resources are elastic-which means they're flexible
- 5. Customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go

# Cloud 3.0 vision
- Applications and functions, not VMS 
- Storage disaggregation, not disks 
- SLAs, not load balancing and scheduling 
- Policy, not "middle boxes" (firewalls) 
- Intelligence, not data processing

## Compute engine
Its an IaaS offering, it provides compute, storage and network.
per-second billing.
## GKE
It runs containerized applications
## App engine
Its a PaaS offering
its a good choice when want to focus on writing code and don't need to build highly reliable and scalable infrastructure.
Example good choices for app engine are web sites, mobile apps, gaming backends and APIs.
## Cloud functions
Cloud functions are light weight event-base, asynchronous compute solution.
it executes code in response to events.
Bills to the nearest 100 ms
## Cloud run
A managed compute platform
Runs stateless containers
Serverless
built on Knative

# GCP Storage
# GCP Acivity Logs
GCP -> Project -> Acitvity

# Vulnerability report
To see vulnerabilities, compliance, threats in a project
GCP -> security command center
Get the project -> check the vulnerability -> identify remediation
